# 02322 Machine Oriented Programming Notes

These are my personal notes for the course **02322 Machine Oriented Programming** at DTU. You are welcome to use these notes for studying, reference, or as a starting point for your own learning. Contributions and suggestions are also welcome!

These notes are structured for use with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), a free note taking app. You can use them as a regular folder of Markdown files, but using Obsidian is recommended for better navigation and linking between notes.

## Getting Started

You have two main options for using these notes:

1. **Simple Download**: Download and use the notes as-is (no updates)
2. **Fork & Sync**: Create your own fork to add personal notes while receiving updates

**I recommend Option 2** if you plan to add your own notes and want to keep receiving updates to the course material.

## Keeping Your Vault Updated

If you used the **Fork & Sync** method, you can regularly pull updates from the original repository while keeping your personal notes.

### Step 1: Commit Your Personal Changes

Before updating, always commit your personal notes:

```bash
# Add your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add my personal notes"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Fetch and Merge Updates

```bash
# Fetch latest changes from the original repository
git fetch upstream

# Merge the updates into your fork
git merge upstream/main

# Push the updates to your fork
git push origin main
```

### Handling Merge Conflicts

If you've modified the same files that were updated in the original repository, you may encounter merge conflicts:

1. Git will mark conflicted files
2. Open the files in Obsidian or a text editor
3. Look for conflict markers (`<<<<<<`, `======`, `>>>>>>`)
4. Choose which version to keep or combine both
5. Remove the conflict markers
6. Commit the resolved conflicts:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
   git push origin main
   ```
